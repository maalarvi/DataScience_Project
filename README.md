# Data Science Project: T2DM vs Non-Diabetic Comparison

This repository contains R scripts used to analyze and visualize differences between adults with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and non-diabetic (ND) individuals. The analysis focuses on four key variables:

- **HbA1c (%)**
- **BMI (kg/m²)**
- **Fasting glucose (mg/dL)**
- **Age (years)**

These indicators are widely used to assess metabolic health and diabetes risk.
